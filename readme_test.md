# Choose Your Own Adventure!

## Rules

- <strong>Goal</strong> Using what you know about data types, variables, operators, conditional blocks, and accepting user input, create a text-based game that allows the user to arrive at different "destinations" based on the inputs they type.

- Any path the user goes down must ask them at least 3 questions(more if you want!)
- There must be a minimum of 7 total destinations the user could arrive at based on their responses.(again more if you want!)
- For at least 1(also can be more!) of the questions asked, there must be more then 2 possible user responses
- Adventure must contain at least one integer response and one string response
- Adventure must contain at least one functional loop in the code base

*hint* you may need `parseInt()` and `toString()`

### Ideas for a game

- A Lord of the Rings style adventure where the player is Frodo, and he must choose how to get to Mordor. Possible obstacles involve Orcs, goblins, and getting drunk on mead.
- A "Top Chef" style cooking adventure where the player is the chef, trying to make dinner for an elite group of judges. Possible obstacles include overcooking the meal, running out of time, or the judges being jerks.
- A Harry Potter themed adventure, where the user is Harry trying to find all the horcruxes. Possible obstacles include Voldemort killing people, Professor Snape being a jerk, or Ron not knowing how to do anything.
